# ADHD-EEG Signal Filtering w/ Salience Maps

This repository hosts all source code used in a project for the COS322 Foundations of Machine Learning course at the University of Southern Maine. 

To gain familiarity with neural networks while exploring a unique approach, we study how filtering EEG signal data for ADHD patients affects binary classification.

## Getting started

To reproduce the experiments conducted for this project, you'll need an up-to-date, working version of Python. 

To utilize this repository, first clone:

`git clone https://github.com/CDurepos/eeg-salience-filter`
`cd eeg-salience-filter`

Install dependencies: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And finally, run the setup script:

`bash bin/setup.sh`
